# Game of Life (Rust, cross-platform)

A native desktop implementation of Conway's Game of Life and other
Life-like cellular automata, built with [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) /
[eframe](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/main/crates/eframe). Runs on
Windows, macOS and Linux from the same codebase.

## Features

- **Generic B/S rule engine** — any Life-like rule (how many live neighbors
  are required for a dead cell to be born, and for a live cell to survive)
  is expressed as a `RuleSet { birth: [bool; 9], survive: [bool; 9] }` and
  evaluated by one generic step function. No rule is hardcoded separately.
- **Rule presets**: 22 built-in Life-like rules — Conway's Life, 2x2, 34 Life,
  Assimilation, Coagulations, Coral, Day & Night, Diamoeba, Flakes, Gnarl,
  HighLife, Inverse Life, Long Life, Maze, Mazectric, Move, Pseudo Life,
  Replicator, Seeds, Serviettes, Stains, Walled Cities — each tagged with its
  long-term random-soup behavior (`stable`, `chaotic`, or `explosive`) in the
  dropdown, e.g. "Diamoeba (chaotic)". Plus 9 Birth / 9 Survive checkboxes to
  build any custom rule by hand.
- **Finite 960x540 plane** (16:9, a half-scale Full HD proportion): live
  cells are stored as a `HashSet<(i64, i64)>` bounded to `x ∈ [-480, 479]`,
  `y ∈ [-270, 269]` (`simulation::WORLD_MIN/WORLD_MAX`) — no wraparound,
  cells simply can't be painted, stamped, or born past the edge (drawn as a
  red boundary line on the canvas), stepped with the standard
  neighbor-counting algorithm (`O(live cells)` per generation). The size is
  an exact multiple of both zoom-range endpoints (`view::MAX_CELL_SIZE` =
  60px, and the dynamic minimum described below both divide it evenly), so
  the world's edge always lines up cleanly with the grid instead of
  clipping a partial cell at some zoom levels.
- **Starting configurations**: a "Start" dropdown + "Load" button (Board
  row) clears the board and lays out a named setup centered on the world —
  Empty board, Random soup, Single glider, Gosper glider gun, Acorn,
  R-pentomino, Diehard, Glider symphony (4 gliders), Pulsar field (3x3).
  Built from the pattern library's own cell data (`src/starts.rs`), so a fix
  to a pattern's shape automatically carries through to any start built from
  it.
- **Three-way toolbox** (Board row): Draw / Pan / Eraser, mutually
  exclusive. Draw is the default click/drag-to-toggle-or-paint behavior.
  Pan makes left-click-drag move the map directly under the cursor — the
  classic Google Maps drag-to-pan gesture, on its own tool since the
  primary button is otherwise needed for drawing (cursor turns into a
  hand/grab icon while active). Eraser forces every click or drag stroke to
  remove cells regardless of their state, with a red outline over the cell
  it would remove. Selecting a pattern from the library switches back to
  Draw automatically. Independent of which tool is active, a middle-mouse-
  button drag always pans too (the Blender/Photoshop/Figma convention), so
  panning is never more than one button away regardless of tool.
- **Collapsible bars**: a "☰" button (top-left, always visible) slides the
  pattern-library panel off-screen, and a "⚙" button collapses the
  Rule/Board/custom-rule rows down to a single essentials strip (the two
  toggles, Draw/Pan/Eraser, Play/Pause, Step, Gen/Live). Both toggle back
  the same way, and neither one hides anything canvas navigation actually
  needs — that's all moved on-canvas (see below), so collapsing both bars
  fully gives the map maximum room without losing any functionality.
- **The map is always a true, undistorted 16:9 rectangle.** Rather than
  stretching the world to fill whatever oddly-shaped area the canvas
  happens to have (window shape minus whatever the bars still take up),
  the canvas computes the largest exact-16:9 rectangle that fits inside
  it (`app::fit_aspect_rect`) and renders the entire map — grid, cells,
  world boundary, all pointer math — through that rectangle alone, letter-
  or pillar-boxing whichever axis doesn't match with a plain dark margin.
  The map's proportions are therefore never distorted or ambiguous
  regardless of window size or which bars are open.
- **The viewport is always fully inside the map.** Panning/zooming is
  clamped (`View::clamp_to_world`) so the visible rectangle can slide right
  up to an edge but never shows empty space beyond it — you can't scroll
  off into the void. If the viewport is ever wider/taller than the map
  itself (very zoomed out on a large window), that axis is centered on the
  map instead.
- **Minimap**: bottom-right overlay showing the whole plane, a green marker
  per occupied region, and a yellow outline for the current viewport. Sized
  to the same 16:9 rectangle as the world itself (not a square), so it
  shows the plane shrunk down evenly instead of stretched. Click or drag
  inside it to jump/pan the camera anywhere on the plane instantly — handy
  since the plane is much bigger than what's visible at once.
- **Zoom & pan, Google Maps-style**: a physical mouse's scroll wheel zooms
  in/out anchored on the cursor, exactly like scrolling on a Google Maps
  page; a laptop trackpad's smooth two-finger scroll pans freely in any
  direction instead, like panning a map on a touchscreen. egui tags every
  scroll event with which device it came from (a mouse wheel reports
  discrete "line" steps, a trackpad reports continuous pixel deltas), so
  the app reads that tag directly rather than merging both into one
  ambiguous scroll signal — the two devices drive genuinely different,
  non-conflicting actions. Pinch gestures and Ctrl/Cmd+scroll always zoom
  regardless of device.
- **On-canvas zoom control**: a small floating panel in the canvas's
  bottom-left corner (mirroring the minimap's placement in the opposite
  corner) with `+`/`-` buttons, a "⟲" reset-view button, and a live
  "Npx/cell" readout — always present regardless of whether the top bar is
  expanded or collapsed, and not tied to gesture recognition. True
  pinch-to-zoom via a laptop touchpad is a platform limitation on Linux
  (winit only wires up `PinchGesture`/`PanGesture` on macOS/iOS), so this
  on-canvas control (plus the wheel/Pan-tool/middle-drag panning above) is
  the primary way to navigate via touchpad there, not just a fallback. A
  "Show input debug" checkbox (Board row) overlays live zoom/scroll/touch
  values on the canvas for diagnosing any input that still seems to do
  nothing.
- **Minimum zoom always shows the whole map** — like Google Maps, you can
  zoom out until the entire plane is on screen, and no further; the exact
  cell size that achieves this is computed every frame from the current
  window size (`view::min_cell_size_to_fit_world`) rather than a fixed
  constant, so it stays correct across window resizes. At that zoom level
  the minimap's yellow viewport outline exactly fills the minimap box,
  since the visible area and the whole world are now the same rectangle.
- **Speed control**: Play/Pause (▶/⏸)/Step (⏭), generations-per-second
  slider. Play/Pause, Step, Clear (🗑), Random (🎲), and the on-canvas zoom
  overlay's buttons are icon buttons with hover tooltips spelling out what
  each one does, using symbols from egui's bundled icon font rather than an
  added dependency.
- **Pattern library**: 35 well-known patterns across 5 categories (still
  lifes, oscillators, spaceships, guns, methuselahs), decoded from standard
  RLE strings verified against LifeWiki and stamped onto the canvas on
  click. A regression test (`cargo test`) checks every pattern's cell count
  against its documented population.
- **Freehand drawing**: click a single cell, or press-and-drag to paint (or
  erase, if the stroke starts on a live cell) a trail of cells.
- **Generation skipping**: a "Skip" dropdown (0/5/10/50/100/500/1000) lets
  Step (or the `S` key) advance several generations at once instead of one.
- **Live stats**: generation count, live-cell count, and cells born/died on
  the most recent step (or across a whole skip batch).
- **Show/hide grid**: checkbox in the top bar, on by default.

## Building & running

Requires a Rust toolchain (installed here via `rustup`, stable channel).

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/conway_life          # Linux/macOS
# or just:
cargo run --release
```

A desktop shortcut was created at `~/Desktop/GameOfLife.desktop` pointing at
the release binary. Depending on your desktop environment you may need to
right-click it once and choose "Allow Launching" / "Trust" the first time.

The code only depends on cross-platform crates (`eframe`, `rand`) with no
OS-specific APIs, so `cargo build --release` should also produce a working
binary on Windows and macOS — only Linux has been built/run in this
environment so far.

## Known issues

- **True pinch-to-zoom trackpad gestures don't reach the app on Linux.**
  This is a `winit` platform limitation, not a bug here: `winit`'s
  `PinchGesture`/`PanGesture`/`RotationGesture` events (which `egui-winit`
  does translate into zoom/pan) are only ever emitted on macOS/iOS — there's
  no code path that produces them on X11 or Wayland. Ctrl+scroll still
  zooms (egui synthesizes that itself from the scroll wheel), and the
  on-screen zoom/pan controls added in the top bar work everywhere
  regardless. Two-finger-scroll-to-pan *should* still work on Linux (it's
  just a regular high-resolution scroll-wheel event, not a special
  gesture) — if it doesn't on a given machine, turn on "Show input debug"
  in the top bar and see whether `scroll_delta` moves at all while
  two-finger-scrolling; that'll tell us whether it's this app, the desktop
  environment intercepting the gesture, or the touchpad driver.
